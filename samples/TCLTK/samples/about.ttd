ttd.text {			    Preamble
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
}
ttd.text {freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
}
ttd.text {License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
}
ttd.text {software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
}
ttd.text {General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
}
ttd.text {Foundations software and to any other program whose authors commit to
}
ttd.text {using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
}
ttd.text {the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
}
ttd.text {your programs, too.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
}
ttd.text {price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
}
ttd.text {have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
}
ttd.text {this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
}
ttd.text {if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
}
ttd.text {in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
}
ttd.text {anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
}
ttd.text {These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
}
ttd.text {distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
}
ttd.text {gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
}
ttd.text {you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
}
ttd.text {source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
}
ttd.text {rights.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
}
ttd.text {(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
}
ttd.text {distribute and/or modify the software.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  Also, for each authors protection and ours, we want to make certain
}
ttd.text {that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
}
ttd.text {software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
}
ttd.text {want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
}
ttd.text {that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
}
ttd.text {authors reputations.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
}
ttd.text {patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
}
ttd.text {program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
}
ttd.text {program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
}
ttd.text {patent must be licensed for everyones free use or not licensed at all.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
}
ttd.text {modification follow.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
}
ttd.text {   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
}
ttd.text {a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
}
ttd.text {under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
}
ttd.text {refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
}
ttd.text {means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
}
ttd.text {that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
}
ttd.text {either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
}
ttd.text {language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
}
ttd.text {the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
}
ttd.text {covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
}
ttd.text {running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
}
ttd.text {is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
}
ttd.text {Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
}
ttd.text {Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Programs
}
ttd.text {source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
}
ttd.text {conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
}
ttd.text {copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
}
ttd.text {notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
}
ttd.text {and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
}
ttd.text {along with the Program.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
}
ttd.text {you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
}
ttd.text {of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
}
ttd.text {distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
}
ttd.text {above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
}
ttd.text {    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
}
ttd.text {    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
}
ttd.text {    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
}
ttd.text {    parties under the terms of this License.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
}
ttd.text {    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
}
ttd.text {    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
}
ttd.text {    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
}
ttd.text {    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
}
ttd.text {    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
}
ttd.text {    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
}
ttd.text {    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
}
ttd.text {    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
}
ttd.text {    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
}
ttd.text {identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
}
ttd.text {and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
}
ttd.text {themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
}
ttd.text {sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
}
ttd.text {distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
}
ttd.text {on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
}
ttd.text {this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
}
ttd.text {entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
}
ttd.text {your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
}
ttd.text {exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
}
ttd.text {collective works based on the Program.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
}
ttd.text {with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
}
ttd.text {a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
}
ttd.text {the scope of this License.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
}
ttd.text {under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
}
ttd.text {Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
}
ttd.text {    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
}
ttd.text {    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
}
ttd.text {    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
}
ttd.text {    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
}
ttd.text {    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
}
ttd.text {    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
}
ttd.text {    customarily used for software interchange; or,
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
}
ttd.text {    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
}
ttd.text {    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
}
ttd.text {    received the program in object code or executable form with such
}
ttd.text {    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
}
ttd.text {making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
}
ttd.text {code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
}
ttd.text {associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
}
ttd.text {control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
}
ttd.text {special exception, the source code distributed need not include
}
ttd.text {anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
}
ttd.text {form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
}
ttd.text {operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
}
ttd.text {itself accompanies the executable.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
}
ttd.text {access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
}
ttd.text {access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
}
ttd.text {distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
}
ttd.text {compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
}
ttd.text {except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
}
ttd.text {otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
}
ttd.text {void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
}
ttd.text {However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
}
ttd.text {this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
}
ttd.text {parties remain in full compliance.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
}
ttd.text {signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
}
ttd.text {distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
}
ttd.text {prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
}
ttd.text {modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
}
ttd.text {Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
}
ttd.text {all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
}
ttd.text {the Program or works based on it.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
}
ttd.text {Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
}
ttd.text {original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
}
ttd.text {these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
}
ttd.text {restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein.
}
ttd.text {You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
}
ttd.text {this License.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
}
ttd.text {infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
}
ttd.text {conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
}
ttd.text {otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
}
ttd.text {excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
}
ttd.text {distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
}
ttd.text {License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
}
ttd.text {may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
}
ttd.text {license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
}
ttd.text {all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
}
ttd.text {the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
}
ttd.text {refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
}
ttd.text {any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
}
ttd.text {apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
}
ttd.text {circumstances.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
}
ttd.text {patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
}
ttd.text {such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
}
ttd.text {integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
}
ttd.text {implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
}
ttd.text {generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
}
ttd.text {through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
}
ttd.text {system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
}
ttd.text {to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
}
ttd.text {impose that choice.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
}
ttd.text {be a consequence of the rest of this License.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
}
ttd.text {certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
}
ttd.text {original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
}
ttd.text {may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
}
ttd.text {those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
}
ttd.text {countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
}
ttd.text {the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
}
ttd.text {of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
}
ttd.text {be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
}
ttd.text {address new problems or concerns.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
}
ttd.text {specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
}
ttd.text {later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
}
ttd.text {either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
}
ttd.text {Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
}
ttd.text {this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
}
ttd.text {Foundation.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
}
ttd.text {programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
}
ttd.text {to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
}
ttd.text {Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
}
ttd.text {make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
}
ttd.text {of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
}
ttd.text {of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {			    NO WARRANTY
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
}
ttd.text {FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
}
ttd.text {OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
}
ttd.text {PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
}
ttd.text {OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
}
ttd.text {MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
}
ttd.text {TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
}
ttd.text {PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
}
ttd.text {REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
}
ttd.text {
}
ttd.text {  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
}
ttd.text {WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
}
ttd.text {REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
}
ttd.text {INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING

ttd.text {OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED

ttd.text {YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
